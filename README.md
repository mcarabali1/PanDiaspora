## About

### Title 
Generating a data repository for documents addressing racial inequalities in Latin America for the Pan Diaspora project 
### Background
Latin America and the Caribbean are considered the most unequal sub-regions within the Pan American region1,2. However, robust evidence on race/ethnicity and health inequalities in the entire Pan American region is still limited1-3. This phenomenon is largely attributed to the absence of- or the limited quality of data on racial or ethnic groups (e.g., Afro-Descendants or Indigenous) in the region4-11. This statistical invisibilization of marginalized racial and ethnic groups and their related inequalities are rooted in several historical issues including colonization and contemporary structural issues associated with racism and discrimination2,12-15. In recent years, Black and Indigenous Movements in the Americas have led mobilization efforts to encourage governments to gather data on race and ethnicity in the region. The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought these issues to the forefront within and across national contexts16,17. Hence, efforts intended to improve the visualization of these populations and the identification of their main pressing issues, are paramount to inform the process of policy making. 

The work plan of this internship is embedded in the Pan-American Data Initiative for the Analysis of Population Racial/Ethnic Health Inequities  (Pan Diaspora) project, aimed at examining the availability, quality and scope of data collected and used on racial/ethnic inequities in urban areas in the Pan-American region.  The focus of the proposed research is to mobilize efforts to obtain and analyze information to a) better understand the existing data on race/ethnicity in the Pan-American region; b) examine their use and the implications on the understanding of health inequalities present in the region over the last 20 years; and c) strengthen and integrate information systems, decision making stakeholders, and academia for the design of strategies to mitigate and eliminate racial health inequities in the Pan American region. 

### Research Question

The overall research question is: What is the availability, scope, and use of existing race/ethnicity data in urban areas of the Pan American region for the analysis of health inequalities? 

## Data

The data can be found under the folder named "metadata_final". Each csv file contains a column for the following categories: PMID, Title, Authors, Citation,First Author, Journal/Book ,Publication Year, Create Date, PMCID, NIHMS ID, DOI, and Mesh Terms.
